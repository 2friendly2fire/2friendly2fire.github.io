			<p>I asked Blizzard to make us a legendary jersey. Of course they agreed. If you check the timestamp on this, I'm pretty sure they got the idea of OWL jerseys from me.</p>
			<p>They said that based on the name "Friendly Fire," they came up with this D-Day inspired Jersey.</p>
			<p>Camo of course - to blend in on the flanks - and then black and white stripes on the arms to identify the player as friendly. Just like Allied planes on D-Day.</p>
			<p>I thought it was a pretty cool concept, and at the very least we've avoided Jersocalypse II.</p>
