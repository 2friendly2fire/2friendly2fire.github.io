<h2>Contesting the objective</h2>

<h3>Calls</h3>
<p>"Point!": The point is in danger, stay on the point.</p>
<p>"Fight on cart", "Fight on point": Fight on the objective, not somewhere else.</p>
<p>"No free cart": Don't let the enemy team push the cart without a fight.</p>

<p>Comp games are won by winning the objective. NOT kills, or anything else.</p>

<p>If the enemy team wants to go and hold their private parts somewhere that's not the objective, then by god let them. Don't risk getting killed anywhere but around-ish the objective.</p>

<p>I shit you not, there is no strategy in a comp game (at anywhere near our level) that involves letting the other team push a payload, hold a point, or capture a point, without contesting. 

<p>The only time you should not be contesting is when you're grouping for numbers.</p>

<p>Saying "I can't contest the objective because [anything but we're grouping for numbers]" is essentially wrong. Change heros, discuss a counter, organize an attack. Not contesting the objective is unambiguously losing the game.</p>
