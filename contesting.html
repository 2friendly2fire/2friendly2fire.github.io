		<h1 class='page-header'>Contesting the objective</h1>

		<h3>Calls</h3>
		<p>"Point!": The point is in danger, stay on the point.</p>
		<p>"Fight on cart", "Fight on point": Fight on the objective, not somewhere else.</p>
		<p>"No free cart": Don't let the enemy team push the cart without a fight.</p>

		<h3>Winning the objective wins games</h3>

		<p>Comp games are won by winning the objective. NOT kills, or anything else.</p>
		<p>I shit you not, there is no strategy in a comp game that involves letting the other team push a payload, hold a point, or capture a point, without contesting.</p> 

		<h3>Mental focus on the objective</h3>

		<p>Teams do need to kill the enemy team to win the objective, but keep the objective front of mind, not kills. It'll help orient you in the game.</p>
		<p>If the enemy team wants to hold their private parts somewhere that's not the objective, then by god let them. Don't risk getting killed anywhere but around-ish the objective.</p>

		<h3>No excuses</h3>

		<p>The only time you should not be contesting is when you're grouping for numbers.</p>
		<p>Saying "I can't contest the objective because [anything but we're grouping for numbers]" is essentially wrong. Change heros, discuss a counter, organize an attack. Not contesting the objective is unambiguously losing the game.</p>
		<p>You could have a billion kills, but if you chase down your billionth-and-first kill and the enemy caps the point, you lose.</p>
