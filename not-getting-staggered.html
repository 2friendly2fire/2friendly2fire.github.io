		<h3>Calls</h3>
		
		<p>"Reset": We've lost the fight, everyone retreat and regroup.</p>
		<p>"Winnable!": I don't think the fight for the objective is lost, don't worry about getting staggered, keep contesting.</p>

		<h3>The flip side: Don't let yourself get staggered</h3>

		<p>If you DO NOT hold the objective, your primary goal is to regroup as quickly as possible to contest the objective again.</p>
		<p>Getting killed (when it is avoidable) after "regroup" or "reset" has been called is pretty much the biggest mistake in Overwatch. It's also one of the most common.</p>
		<p>If your team is regrouping for the next fight, the only thing you should be doing is backing-the-fuck-up to the team.</p>
		<p>If you get killed during this phase, really the only thing you can say is "Damn." There isn't really anything else as useful as staying alive during this phase.</p>

		<h3>Even kills aren't that useful</h3>

		<p>If you get a kill and then get killed, that person will get back before you, with objective time ticking down all the while. Not very useful.</p>

		<h3>Hmmm... be careful.</h3>

		<p>An advanced tactic is to build ult during this phase, but ... just be careful. Especially if there's a one-shot character out there. Really, just don't.</p>

		<h3>Maybe we can still win...</h3>

		<p>This call fits in a few places, but I'll discuss it here.</p>
		<p>The "winnable" call means that it's someone's opinion that you should keep contesting the objective; the objective might still be won.</p>

		<p>If "winnable" is called, and ntil "regroup" or "reset" is called, anyone alive should be fighting for the objective.</p> 
		<p>Anyone respawning should be running in to help as fast as possible.</p>

		<h3>The exceptions</h3>
		
		<p>There are three cases for which it is fine to stagger.</p>
		<p>First, when your team has the control point on king of the hill. It's fine to go in one at a time to hold the point, your objective % is ticking up. This is unambiguous.</p>
		<p>Second, to stall a payload on defense. This is a judgement call, but if you can keep the payload from moving while the enemy's time is ticking down, this is generally a good thing.</p>
		<p>Third, to stall the control point on defense in 2CP. This is also a bit of a judgement call. It might be better to hold a few seconds for numbers, but pay close attention to the enemy tick-level.</p>
