		<h3>Calls</h3>
		<p>"Reset": We've lost the fight, everyone retreat and regroup.</p>
		<p>"[passive aggressive]Regroup...": You messed up.</p>
		<p>"Winnable!": I don't think the fight for the objective is lost, don't worry about getting staggered, keep contesting.</p>

		<p>If you DO NOT hold the objective, your primary goal is to regroup as quickly as possible to contest the objective again.</p>

		<p>Getting killed (when it is avoidable) after "regroup" or "reset" is called is pretty much the biggest mistake in Overwatch. It's also one of the most common.</p>

		<p>If your team is regrouping for the next fight, the only thing you should be doing is backing the fuck up to the team.</p>

		<p>If you get killed during this phase, really the only thing you can say is "Damn." There isn't really anything else as useful as staying alive during this phase.</p>

		<p>A more advanced tactic is to build ult during this phase, but ... just better not.</p>

		<p>The "winnable" call means that it's someone's opinion that the contest phase is not over, and that the objective might still be won.</p>

		<p>Until "regroup" is called, anyone alive should be fighting for the objective and anyone respawning should be running in to help as fast as possible.</p>
