		<h3>Calls</h3>
		<p>"Don't use ults": Ultimates aren't useful right now.</p>

		<h3>Ults are valuable</h3>

		<p>Ults are game changers. A very common mistake in OW is using an ult after the fight has been lost (a panic ult) or after it's been won. Effectively wasting it.</p>
		<p>The call to not use an ult means that it is not needed, and that it should be saved for the next fight.</p>

		<h3>Don't look at the kill cam, watch your team fight if you're dead</h3>

		<p>This is a good call for dead players to make. It's very common for people to try to ult in a panic to win a fight that can't be won. Dead players watching can see this easier than someone in the fight.</p>

		<p>Making calls when dead is generally pretty useful. The camera will give you a good idea what's going on.</p>

		<h3>Coordinate ults</h3>

		<p>Another thing to keep in mind is to not using ults redudantly. Say a Grav and a Slam.</p>
		<p>This is coordinated through voice.</p>
		<p>Try to coordinate ults. Make sure people are around to make use of them etc.</p>
