<h2 class='page-header'>Not wasting ults</h2>

<h3>Calls</h3>
<p>"Don't use ults": Ultimates aren't useful right now.</p>

<p>Ults are game changers. A very common mistake in OW is using an ult after the fight has been lost (a panic ult) or after it's been won. Effectively wasting it.</p>

<p>The call to not use an ult means that it is not needed, and that it should be saved for the next fight.</p>

<p>This is a good call for dead players to make. It's very common for people to try to ult in a panic to win a fight that can't be won. Dead players watching can see this easier than someone in the fight.</p>

<p>Another dimension is not using ults redudantly. Say a Grav and a Slam. This is coordinated through voice.</p>

<p>Try to coordinate ults. Make sure people are around to make use of them etc.</p>
