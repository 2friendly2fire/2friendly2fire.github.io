		<h1 class='page-header'>The Objective</h1>

		<p>You win a comp game by holding the objective.</p>
		<p>Not kills, not medals, not stats.</p>
		<p>You win by pushing the payload further than the enemy team, by being king of the hill, or by capturing the most ticks on a point.</p>

		<h3>The Contest-Regroup cycle</h3>
		<p><a href='/hero-advantage.html'>Numbers advantage</a> combined with playing the objective produces the repeating flow of a comp match:</p>

		<p class='bold'>Group up for numbers</p>
		<p class='bold'>Contest the objective with numbers</p>
		<p>...repeat</p>

		<p>If your team WINS the objective after contesting, your goal is to increase your objective time by MAXIMIZING the time until the enemy team can contest the objective with numbers.</p>

		<p>If your team LOSES the objective, your goal is to MINIMIZE the time until you can contest the objective with numbers.</p>

		<p>This is the structure of an Overwatch comp match.</p>
