		<h2 class='page-header'>The Objective</h2>

		<p>You win a comp game by holding the objective.</p>

		<p>Not kills, not medals, not stats.</p>
		<p>You win by pushing the payload further than the enemy team, by being king of the hill, or by capturing the most points.</p>

		<p>The concept of <a href='/hero-advantage.html'>Hero advantage</a> combined with playing the objective produces the flow of a comp match:</p>

		<div class='circle'>Group up for numbers<div>
		<div class='circle'>Contest the objective with numbers</div>

		<p>If your team WINS the objective, your goal is to increase your objective time by MAXIMIZING the time until the enemy team can again contest the objective with numbers.</p>

		<p>If your team LOSES the objective, your goal is to MINIMIZE the time until you can again contest the objective with numbers.</p>

		<p>This is the dynamic of an overwatch match.</p>
