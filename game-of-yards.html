		<h2 class='page-header'>A game of yards</h2>

		<p>A comp game is symmetric. If you have to push a payload, the next round will require the enemy to push the payload on the same map. If you're attacking control points one round, the next you'll be defending.</p>
		<p>Unlike Quick Play, which is an asymmetric game mode, the team that gets further on the objective will be the winner.</p>
		<p>Why is this important?</p>

		<h3>Don't hail mary</h3>

		<p>Always remember the flow of an Overwatch game: Contest and regroup, contest and regroup...</p>
		<p>You don't need to get right to the end of a payload map, just further than the enemy team. Getting impatient and throwing yourself at the objective is not useful.</p>

		<p>Better to get a few more yards than hail mary the end-zone.</p>

		<h3>Don't assume a loss</h3>

		<p>A bad phase (defence or offense) does not mean you've lost the match.</p>
		<p>It is a regular feature of comp to have a shit round, followed by a stellar round. Never tilt out or assume the loss. I'd go so far as to say 20% of games don't end as you might expect after a disaster of a first round. That's a lot.</p>
