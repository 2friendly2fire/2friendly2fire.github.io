		<h1 class='page-header'>A game of yards</h1>

		<p>A comp game is symmetric. If you defend the first round, you attack next round.</p>
		<p>Unlike Quick Play, the team that gets further on the objective (more payload distance, more ticks on a control point etc.) will be the winner.</p>
		<p>Why is this important?</p>

		<h3>Don't hail mary</h3>

		<p>Always remember the flow of an Overwatch game: Contest and regroup, contest and regroup...</p>
		<p>You don't need to get right to the end of a payload map to win, just further than the enemy team. Getting impatient and throwing yourself at the objective only to die is not useful.</p>

		<p>It's better to organize and get a few more yards than hail mary the end zone and get nothing.</p>

		<h3>Don't assume a loss</h3>

		<p>A bad round (defence or offense) does not mean you've lost the match.</p>
		<p>It is a regular feature of comp to have a bad round, followed by a stellar round. Never tilt-out or assume the loss. 
		<p>I'd go so far as to say 20% of games don't end as you might expect after a disaster of a first round. That's a lot.</p>
