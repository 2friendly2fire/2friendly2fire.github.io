		<h3>Calls</h3>
		<p>"Group up": Gather as a team so that we contest the objective with maximum numbers.</p>

		<h3>Why group up?</h3>
		<p>Numbers advantage is the key to Overwatch. Grouping up before contesting the objective gives you the best chance of winning the fight.</p>

		<p>It doesn't mean the team needs to be in a ball. It means the entire team, or as much of it as possible (if you're short on time) is ready to fight at the objective - together.</p>

		<h3>Take the call seriously</h3>
		<p>It can be unavoidable, but if you otherwise die after "group up" has being called - You fucked up.</p>
