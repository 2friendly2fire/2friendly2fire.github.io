		<h3>Calls</h3>
		<p>"Group up"</p>

		<p>Numbers advantage is the key to Overwatch. Grouping up before contesting the objective gives you the best chance of winning the fight.</p>

		<p>It doesn't mean the team needs to be in a ball. It means the entire team, or as much as possible (if you're short on time) is ready to fight at the objective - together.</p>

		<p>It can be unavoidable, but if you otherwise die while "group up" is being called - You fucked up.</p>
