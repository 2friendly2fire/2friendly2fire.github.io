<h2 class='page-header'>Targets</h2>

<h3>Calls</h3>
<p>"Focus [hero x]": We should all focus hero 'x'.</p>

<p>Focus fire is very effective for gaining a numbers advantage. Calling out a specific target for the team helps the team focus on the target.</p>

<p>Targeting priority depends a lot on experience. Two of the most important targets are the following:</p>

<p>An enemy player out of position. An enemy that is too aggressive, or too far from their team, is usually the best target to prioritize.</p>

<p>You can take them down singly without having to deal with the rest of their team getting in the way. Looking for these opportunities is key.</p>

<p>The numbers advantage is always key.</p>

<p>Secondly, an enemy that is low on health, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Otherwise, try to pick off healers or DPS: The squishier heros. Blasting away at tanks is easy, but not always that effective if they're just getting healed. Not to mention you're charging up enemy support ults by doing this.</p>

<p>If there's nothing else to do, shoot an enemy shield. Breaking shields is always important. Lay it down on those shields, especially when there's nothing better to do.</p>
