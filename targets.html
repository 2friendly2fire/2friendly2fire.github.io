		<h3>Calls</h3>

		<p>"Focus [hero x]": We should all focus hero 'x'.</p>
		<p>"Break the shield": Shoot at the enemy sheild.</p>

		<h3>Focus fire</h3>

		<p>Focus fire is very effective for gaining a numbers advantage. Calling out a specific target for the team helps the team focus their fire.</p>
		<p>Targeting priority depends a lot on experience/judgement/game knowledge.</p>
		<p>Here are a few basics.</p>

		<h3>Out of position enemies</h3>

		<p>An enemy out-of-position is often the best player for the team to focus.</p> 
		<p>This usually includes an enemy that is too aggressive, or too far from their team. Call these out.</p>
		<p>Take them down singly without having to deal with the rest of their team. Looking for these opportunities to create a numbers advantage is key.</p>

		<h3>Low health</h3>

		<p>An enemy that is low on health is easier to kill, for obvious reasons.</p>
		<p>It's always best to take an enemy off the field. They can't be healed, and even if they only have a bar of health, their damage/healing/ult output is the same.</p>

		<h3>Squishies</h3>

		<p>Otherwise, try to pick off healers or DPS: The squishier heros. Blasting away at tanks is easy, but not always that effective if they're just getting healed. Not to mention you're charging up enemy support ults by doing this.</p>

		<h3>Shields</h3>

		<p>Shoot enemy shields if there isn't a higher priority target. Breaking shields is always important. Lay it down on those shields, especially when there's nothing better to do.</p>
