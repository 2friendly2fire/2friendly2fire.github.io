<h2 class='page-header'>Staggering</h2>

<h3>Calls</h3>
<p>"Chase!", "Stagger!": Run down exposed enemy players</p>

<p>One of the most important tactics in a comp game WHEN YOU HOLD THE OBJECTIVE is to increase the time it takes for the enemy team to regroup to contest the objective with numbers.</p>

<p>If you have the objective, and you have numbers, you have the winning conditions.</p>

<p>The way to stagger is to kill enemy players while the bulk of their team is respawning/regrouping.</p>

<h4>Example 1: Staggering after winning the objective</h4>

<p>You win the objective. 4 of your players are alive, 4 of theirs are dead and 2 are retreating. You have a 4v2 advantage.</p>

<p>It takes 10 seconds to respawn (usually). If you chase down the remaining 2 and kill them with your numbers advantage, it'll take the enemy team at least 10 seconds + the time to get back to the objective AFTER the last kill to contest again.</p>

<p>This can add huge objective time for you.</p>

<h4>Example 2: Aggressive staggering</h4>

<p>At our level, players will often get impatient and rush the objective instead of waiting to regoup.</p>

<p>Playing aggressive with numbers advantage to pick off these players can also prevent the enemy from quickly regrouping.</p>

<p>You must be careful not to lose players when the enemy team is close to regrouped. You will not have numbers advantage next fight.</p>
