		<h1 class='page-header'>Not Tilting</h1>

		<p>Overwatch is a tilt-inducing game. Tilting does seem to affect your abipty to play the game, aside from making it unpleasant for your team members.</p>
		<p>There are a few things I keep in mind to keep tilt under control.</p>

		<h3>Overwatch is hard</h3>
		<p>You lose at least 40% of games. That's just how it is. Can't win 'em all.</p>
		<p>Accept that you suck at OW, or that there's lots you could do better. Made a big difference for me.</p>
		<p>It's unlikely in a comp game where everyone is communicating, cooperating and coordinating hero picks that you're losing because of your team. Either the other team is straight better, or a few key mistakes were made. Hands down some of them were yours.</p>

		<h3>Medals 1</h3>
		<p>Medals are basically useless as an indicator of anything. I fall into this trap too, I get it, but their only use is against your own team.</p>
		<p>It's unlikely in most games that anyone is very far behind you in medal count. Wins and close games usually involve the entire team.</p>
		<h3>Medals 2</h3>
		<p>Medals don't tell you much about your own performance.</p> 
		<p>In the Mercy meta, a player that managed to kill the enemy mercy every round and then died - say 5 elims - is hands down the most useful player on the team. A mercy that can never rez effectively removes a notional enemy player every 30 seconds. Plus no healing. All the other medals on that team are basically cleanup.</p>

		<h3>Medals 3</h3>
		<p>If you ever say or think "Well I've got x medals" you're actively making yourself worse at the game. Medals only have one use, and that's to throw in someone's face if they criticise you; the "I know you are but what am I?" of Overwatch.</p>

		<h3>Throwing/giving up</h3>
		<p>If you tilt out and throw a game, the only certainy is that you lost the game. Unbelievable comebacks are a regular feature of comp, and one of the most fun parts.</p>
		<p>Often, a simple hero switch at the near-last minute can turn the tide.</p>
