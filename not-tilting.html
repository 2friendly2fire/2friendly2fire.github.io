		<h2 class='page-header'>Not Tilting</h2>

		<p>Overwatch is a tilt-inducing game. Tilting does seem to affect your ability to play the game, aside from making it unpleasant for your team members.</p>

		<p>A couple things to remember about tilt:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>You lose at least 30-40% of games. That's just how it is. Can't win 'em all.</li>
			<li>Accept that you suck at OW, or that there's lots you could do better. Made a big difference for me.</li>
			<li>It's unlikely in a comp game where everyone is communicating, cooperating and coordinating hero picks that you're losing because of your team. Either the other team is straight better, or a few key mistakes were made. Hands down some of them were yours.</li>
			<li>Medals are basically useless. I fall into this trap too, I get it. But their only use is against your own team. It's also quite unlikely in most games that anyone is very far behind you in medal count. Wins and close games usually involve the entire team.</li>
			<li>Medals 2: They also don't tell you much about your own performance. For example, in the current Mercy meta, a player that managed to kill the enemy mercy every round and then died - say 5 elims - is hands down the most useful player on the team. A mercy that can never rez effectively removes a notional enemy player every 30 seconds. Plus no healing. All the other medals on that team are basically cleanup.</li>
			<li>Medals 3: If you ever say or think "Well I've got x medals" you're actively making yourself worse at the game. Medals only have one use, and that's to throw in someone's face if they criticise you; the "I know you are but what am I?" of Overwatch.</li>
			<li>If you tilt out and throw a game, YOU lost the game. Unbelievable comebacks are a regular feature of Comp, and one of the most fun parts.</li>
		</ul>
