		<h1 class='page-header'>Hero advantage</h1>

		<p>Almost everything that happens in competitive results from the power of numbers advantage.</p>
		<p>The team with more players alive in the fight has a significant advantage.</p>
		<p>The advantage of the team with superior numbers snowballs as the numbers become more uneven. Gaming math has it that it's exponential.</p>

		<h3>Why do people hate "leavers" in competitive?</h3>

		<p>If a player drops in comp so that the game becomes a 5v6, the team with 5 will almost NEVER win. It would be a stunning defeat for the 6 player team were this to happen.</p>
		<p>This power dynamic is also present throughout each fight in a normal game - whenever a numbers advantage exists for either team.</p>
		<p>Comp is about using this basic feature of the game to win the objective.</p>
