		<h1 class='page-header'>Hero advantage</h1>

		<p>Almost everything that happens in competitive is rooted in the concept of numbers advantage.</p>

		<p>The team with more alive players - in the fight - has a significant advantage.</p>

		<p>The advantage of the team with superior numbers snowballs as the numbers become more uneven.</p>

		<p>To make the point, if a player drops in comp so that the game becomes a 5v6, the team with 5 will almost NEVER win. It would be a stunning defeat for the 6 player team, were this to happen.</p>

		<p>This power dynamic is thus also present throughout the game.</p>

		<p>Comp is about using this basic feature of the game to win the objective.</p>
