		<h3>Calls</h3>
		<p>No specific calls. General communication about positioning is important.</p>

		<h3>I'm not joking</h3>

		<p>It sounds dumb, and facetious, but NOT DYING is probably the most important thing anyone can do.</p>
		<p>It's also a very simple objective to keep in mind that'll keep you focused on what's important.</p>

		<h3>Example: Dying on defense</h3>

		<p>If you're on defense and your team does not die, you're halfway to winning the game. Simple (if unrealistic).</p>
		<p>Somone playing aggressive on defence and getting killed means they're usually at fault for losing the point 20 seconds later.</p>
		<p>Don't setup your defenses where you can't retreat to cover or rely on your team.</p>

		<h3>Feeding</h3>

		<p>People often misunderstand why they're losing a game when someone is dying too much. The cause is usually called 'feeding.'</p>
		<p>It's the concept of too many avoidable deaths producing a consistent numbers advantage for the enemy team.</p>
		<p>It's fine to die contesting the objective as a team. Dying out of position for no benefit, or while your team is regrouping is generally considered to be feeding. It's bad. </p>

		<h3>DO. NOT. DUEL.</h3>

		<p>Comp is won by winning objectives. Not by killing people. Staying alive to contest is (usually) more important than getting a kill.</p>
		<p>Don't duel. Newer players often go to fight, and they fight until they die or the enemy player does.</p> 
		<p>Wrong. This a bad habit, best to get out of.</p>

		<p>Back up, use cover, come back to where your healers can heal you. Use a local numbers advantage. Use your tanks for cover.</p>
		<p>Play smart and safe and wait for the enemy to get impatient. Kill them with your team when they're out of position.</p>

		<h3>Caveat: Contest the objective</h3>

		<p>The above only applies if you're contesting the objective. Not dying and not contesting is also losing. Fight on that cart.</p>
		<p>Playing too passive is a thing as well. Tanks lead the way.</p>
