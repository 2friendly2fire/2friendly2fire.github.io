<h2>Not dying</h2>

<h3>Calls</h3>
<p>No specific calls. General communication about positioning is important.</p>

<p>It sounds dumb, and facetious, but NOT DYING is probably the most important thing anyone can do.</p>

<p>For example, if you're on defense and your team does not die, you're halfway to winning the game. Simple (if unrealistic). Playing aggressive on defence and getting killed means you're usually at fault for the point loss that inevitably happens 20 seconds later. If you die on the point, well, good try.</p>

<p>People often misinterpret why they're losing in these games. It's called 'feeding.'</p>

<p>It's the concept of too many avoidable deaths producing a consistent numbers advantage for the enemy team.</p>

<p>Comp is won by winning objectives. Not by killing people. Staying alive to contest is (usually) more important than getting a kill.</p>

<p>Don't duel. Newer players often go to fight, and they fight until they die or the enemy player does. Wrong.</p>

<p>Back up, use cover, come back to where your healers can heal you. Use a local numbers advantage. Use your tanks for cover.</p>

<p>Play smart and safe and wait for the enemy to get impatient. Kill them with the team when they're out of position.</p>

<p>Of course, this only applies if you're contesting the objective. Not dying and not contesting is also losing. Fight on that cart.</p>
