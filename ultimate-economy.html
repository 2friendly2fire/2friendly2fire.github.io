		<h1 class='page-header'>Ultimate economy</h1>

		<p>Ults are a huge part of Overwatch. After the dynamic of a match (contest and regroup), OW is a game of ults.</p>
		<p>Ultimate economy refers to the idea of generating ult vs. feeding it to the enemy team.</p>
		<p>There's a ton of depth here. At our level, we only need to remember a few things.</p>

		<h3>Ult charge from damage and healing</h3>
		<p>You want to generate as much ult as you can through damage and healing. 
		<p>You want to deny it to the enemy team by preventing them from doing damage to you, or creating lots of healing opportunities for them.</p>
		<p>This idea produces a lot of subtle interactions in the game, with all sorts of implications.</p>

		<h3>Ult economy example: Duelling Zaryas</h3>
		
		<p>Say both teams have a Zarya. The team with a Reinhardt (a shield) will likely build their Zarya ult much faster than the opposing team.</p>
		<p>Any damage Zarya does to a shield will NOT produce ult charge, while the other Zarya will rack up ult charge on the unshielded team.</p>
		<p>The ult economy is in favour of the shielded Zarya.</p> 
		<p>All else being equal - even Zaryas of equal skill - the Zarya that gets grav first will likely win that objective phase.</p>
