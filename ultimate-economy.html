<h2 class='page-header'>Ultimate economy</h2>

<p>Ults are a huge part of Overwatch. After the dynamic of a match (contest and regroup), OW is a game of ults.</p>

<p>Ultimate economy refers to the idea of generating ult vs. feeding it to the enemy team.</p>

<p>There's a ton of depth here. At our level, the following is probably enough to know:</p>

<p>You want to generate as much ult as you can by doing damage and healing, and deny it to the enemy team by preventing them from doing damage to you, or creating lots of healing opportunities for them.</p>

<p>This idea produces lots of subtle interactions in the game that have all kinds of implications. Here's an example for team comp:</p>

<p>Say both teams have a Zarya. The team with a Reinhardt (a shield) will likely build their Zarya ult much faster than the opposing team.</p>

<p>Any damage Zarya does to the shield will NOT produce ult charge, while the other Zarya will rack up ult charge on the unshielded team.</p>

<p>The ult economy is in favour of the shielded Zarya.</p> 

<p>All else being equal - even Zaryas of equal skill - the Zarya that gets grav first will likely win that objective phase.</p>
